# AutoClicker
.exe in dist/ is previous working version. Currently am aware if downloaded on it's own Windows will yell that it is Malware, I want to fix this in the next build.

The previous build of this program was designed to be for a specific use case, my goal in these updates is to flesh out this idea and turn it into a full fledged useful program.

## Controls
    > tab to start/stop
    > up-arrow toggle click speed (60s -> 1s)
    > esc exit program

## To-Do:
    > Find a way to have user input interact with GUI elements
    > Implement auto clicker functionality with GUI options
    > Implement custom macros for users to program
    > Implement database to store user options & macros
    > Add customization to GUI keyboard layout & size to more closely resemble users keyboard
